<h1 align="left"> Hello, I'm Luna 🌕⚡</h1>

I’m a 2nd-year Electrical Engineering student @ **University of Waterloo**. I like embedded systems, PCB design (Altium), and sensor/DAQ projects (LabJack, I2C). Currently building a NiceGUI-based gas sensor characterization app. I am also interested in the design of User Interface for website!
